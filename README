jsborg
======

sprocketize-inspired javascript preprocessing script. Allows modularized
javascript app-development, with the help of pre-defined actions.

Currently supported actions are:

    //= require "<filename>"
    //= require <jsroot/utils/file>

the "require" action also supports defines. With this conditional
requires (e.g unittests) are possible.

    //= require "<filename>" if DEBUG

Usage
=====

    $ jsborg jsroot jsroot/root.js

this will compile the jsroot/root.js file, by setting the "jsroot"
directory as the root directory, and the output redirected to stdout.

    $ jsborg jsroot jsroot/root.js > compiled.js

in order to save the output.

User-specified Defines can be set via

    $ jsborg -D DEBUG jsroot jsroot/root.js > compile.js
